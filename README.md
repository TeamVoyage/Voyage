## Development

Once you have forked the repo from https://github.com/HackBlocks/Voyage , install all the dependencies.

### Installing Dependencies

From within the root directory:

1) npm install
2) Create .env file (Follow steps below to set up .env file)
3) npm run react-dev
4) npm run server-dev

### Create env File

Inside the root folder, create a new file named ".env". Inside this file you will want to have to following:

`export YELP_API_KEY="(paste key value here)"`

## Getting the tokens for the API calls

We use Yelp's API to collect the data, so you will need an API key for Yelp to make requests. There are links below to create your own API key.
* [Yelp API Key](https://www.yelp.com/fusion)
